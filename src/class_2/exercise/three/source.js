   TODO: In the following code, implement an enum type called Season that represents 
   the constants "Fall", "Winter", "Spring", and "Summer". Then, update the function so 
   you can pass in the season by referencing an item in the enum, for example 
   Season.Fall, instead of the literal string "Fall". */
